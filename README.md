# Finger Camera Tracking

An android app which detects a finger moving left to right or right to left while touching the back camera, and prints that direction on the screen.

# Limitations (to fix)

* A direction label is always displayed once initialized, even when there is no motion
* Sometimes, the direction label might be inaccurate when capturing extremely slow or extremely fast motion

# Method

In progress.
